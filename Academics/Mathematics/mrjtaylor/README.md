# mrjtaylor
The mrjtaylor section contains different programs that grab the data from [mrjtaylor.weebly.com](https://mrjtaylor.weebly.com),    
where Mr. Jim Taylor posts his student's grades (specifically [this path inside his website](http://mrjtaylor.weebly.com/mpm-1dw---class-marks.html).    
The collected data can then be used for various analytics and graphing over time.    
# Original Files
### mark_harvest_server.py
This file will run forever on a computer, and every day ( 1 * 60 * 60 * 24 seconds) it will    
grab data from [mrjtaylor.weebly.com/mpm-1dw---class-marks.html](http://mrjtaylor.weebly.com/mpm-1dw---class-marks.html)
### grab_marks.js
As just an experimental program, `grab_marks.js` is meant to be run on [mrjtaylor.weebly.com/mpm-1dw---class-marks.html](http://mrjtaylor.weebly.com/mpm-1dw---class-marks.html)    
and will output data in the developer console of a browser.
